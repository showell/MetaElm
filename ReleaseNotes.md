- add examples
- eval/emit list/tuples more aggressively
- rename F1/F2 to A1/A2

1.1.0
-----
    This version could do basic operations on lists, tuples,
    etc.  I publicized it a bit, but I don't believe anybody
    was using it.  There are no release notes for this or any
    other earlier release.
