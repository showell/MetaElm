# meta-elm

Elm runtime on top of Elm, running in pure Elm

# Description

This project allows you to write Elm code in a
DSL that:

- can be evaluated inside Elm
- can be serialized to simpler Elm code

It's kinda like elm-in-elm, but it's smaller and
targeted specifically at running Elm natively in Elm.
